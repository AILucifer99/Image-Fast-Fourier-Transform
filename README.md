# Image-Fast-Fourier-Transform
An implementation of Fast Fourier Transform on real world images for understanding the frequencies of the corresponding images 

# Usage Guidelines
# Cloaning the repository
Once the cloaning of the repository is done using the git command. Follow the below guides to perform Fourier Transform on images.

# Fourier Transform
The repository explains the concept of FFT on images, using OpenCV and Numpy. To perform FFT on images, just add the custom images to the "Custom-Images" folder. Once the images are uploaded to the folder, just run the file using the command, "python main.py". 

# Running main.py
Once we run the main.py file, we have to provide the folder name in which the images are placed, in our case, type "Custom-Images" as the image folder path.
